EXP 9

1. A Cone base 75 mm diameter and axis 80 mm long is resting on its base on H.P. It is cut
by a section plane perpendicular to the V.P., inclined at 45o to the H.P. and cutting the axis at
a point 35 mm from the apex. Draw the front view, sectional top view, sectional side view
and true shape of the section.

2. A square pyramid, base 50 mm side and axis 75 mm long, has its base on the ground and
all the edges of the base equally inclined to the wall. It is cut by a section plane,
perpendicular to the wall, inclined at 40ยบ to the ground and bisecting the axis. Draw its
sectional top view, sectional side view and true shape of the section.

3. A hexagonal pyramid, base 30 mm side and axis 65 mm long is resting on its base on the
ground, with two edges of the base parallel to the wall. It is cut by a section plane
perpendicular to wall and inclined at 45ยบ to the ground, intersecting the axis at a point 25 mm
above the base. Draw the front view, sectional top view, sectional side view and true shape of
the section.

4. A cylinder of 50 mm diameter, 70 mm height and having its axis vertical is cut by a section
plane, perpendicular to the VP, inclined at 40ยบ to the HP and intersecting the axis 30 mm
above the base. Draw its front view, sectional top view, sectional side view and the true shape
of the section.
